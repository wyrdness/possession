      "full": "Possession is the belief that spirits, demons, or other entities can inhabit and control human bodies. Characteristics include dramatic personality changes, speaking unknown languages (glossolalia or xenoglossy), superhuman strength, knowledge of hidden things, convulsions, and aversion to sacred objects. Types vary by culture: demonic possession (Christian), spirit possession (various cultures), and voluntary possession (shamanic traditions). Famous cases include Anneliese Michel (1976, Germany) and Roland Doe (1949, inspiration for 'The Exorcist'). Theories range from genuine spiritual possession (religious view) to mental illness explanations including dissociative identity disorder (DID), schizophrenia, epilepsy, and cultural syndrome. Scientific consensus attributes symptoms to psychiatric conditions, though possession remains an active religious belief worldwide requiring cultural sensitivity."
