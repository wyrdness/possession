## Overview

Possession is the belief that spirits, demons, or other entities can inhabit and control human bodies. Manifestations include dramatic personality changes, speaking unknown languages (glossolalia), superhuman strength, knowledge of hidden things, convulsions, and aversion to sacred objects.

**Types vary by culture**:
- **Demonic possession** (Christian) — Involuntary, evil
- **Spirit possession** (various cultures) — Ancestors, nature spirits, etc.
- **Voluntary possession** (shamanic, Vodou) — Intentional for ritual purposes
- **Jinn possession** (Islamic) — Supernatural beings

Famous cases include **Anneliese Michel** (1976, died during exorcism) and **Roland Doe** (1949, inspired *The Exorcist*).

**Scientific consensus**: Symptoms are explained by psychiatric conditions (dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy) and cultural syndrome. Religious traditions continue exorcism practices.
